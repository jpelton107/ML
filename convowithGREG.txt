Get Are Frake: im still workin on "Medieval Legends"
RockstarGuitar07: sweet sweet
RockstarGuitar07: show me what you g0t
RockstarGuitar07: if possible
RockstarGuitar07: not possible 'eh :-(
Get Are Frake: um.. right now im makin a story line
Get Are Frake: this is what i have so far
Get Are Frake: "Long ago, the empire of Rome was ruled by a fierce leader.  Conquering, and expanding his empire, he became greedy.  Slowly, the empire of Rome began to slip out of his grip.  Realizing the near downfall of Rome, the senate determined it was time for the emporer to be quietly excecuted.  Who will rule the empire next?  Prove yourself. For empire. For family. For self."
Get Are Frake: im gonna add more to the story later
RockstarGuitar07: sweet sweet
RockstarGuitar07: so are we gonna have to be all 'diplomatic' and stuff?
Get Are Frake: i havent decided yet
Get Are Frake: i know that its going to be "Experience" based(like SF: networth)
Get Are Frake: i'll probably make it so you can use diplomacy to gain exp
Get Are Frake: right now im just doing work on the "sign-up"/"login" pages :-P
Get Are Frake: and the overall structure
Get Are Frake: nothing deep yet
RockstarGuitar07: sweet sweet
Get Are Frake: do you think its a decent plot?
RockstarGuitar07: if you're strugglin' with nerdy things...i can help ;-)
RockstarGuitar07: yeah it sounds good
RockstarGuitar07: i wouldn't enjoy HAVING to be diplomatic...
Get Are Frake: k
RockstarGuitar07: i'm all about da strength/military
Get Are Frake: when i get into ideas about that, ill have you over or somethin
RockstarGuitar07: i mean i'd do some of it, but i wouldn't want that to be the ONLY way to success
Get Are Frake: but right now im just wokrin on coding
RockstarGuitar07: ah
RockstarGuitar07: PHP action?
Get Are Frake: yep
Get Are Frake: ill probably keep the graphics minimal too
Get Are Frake: more than sf...
Get Are Frake: but for the most part minimal
RockstarGuitar07: i can help with da graphics possibly
RockstarGuitar07: If you want
RockstarGuitar07: (i think i might take a web-page programming class at school, just to get rid of my required comp class credits)
Get Are Frake: that'd be cool :-)
RockstarGuitar07: yeah, just to get the basics y'know
RockstarGuitar07: and hey, maybe senior year i could take the 'advanced' classes
RockstarGuitar07: (where they go far past html... hah)
Get Are Frake: :-)
Get Are Frake: what attributes should i make the characters have/how could i have them effect battles/etc?
Get Are Frake: Strength (atk)
Get Are Frake: Dex (travel time?)
Get Are Frake: Dexterity
Get Are Frake: *
Get Are Frake: Speed (travel time)
Get Are Frake: i dunno what else tho
RockstarGuitar07: dexterity could also be the ability to wear a certain level of armor
RockstarGuitar07: such as an armor piece requires 10 dexterity to wear
Get Are Frake: yea.. nice idea
RockstarGuitar07: agility?
RockstarGuitar07: agility could add to the ability to dodge... but that might get complicated
Get Are Frake: hmm
RockstarGuitar07: or perhaps it could function as the 'engines'
Get Are Frake: nice thot
Get Are Frake: i was thinkin speed for that
RockstarGuitar07: k
RockstarGuitar07: oh i didn't see that one
RockstarGuitar07: sorry
RockstarGuitar07: Inteligence?
Get Are Frake: yea!!
Get Are Frake: good one
RockstarGuitar07: (magic users!!!!!!!!!)
Get Are Frake: that can be for diplomacy
Get Are Frake: (we'll get into that after beta)
RockstarGuitar07: (jk on the magic. i just got it from there)
Get Are Frake: im gonna try to get a beta goin befroe too long.. w/ simplicity(layout/etc.)
RockstarGuitar07: (magic could make things weeird possibly)
RockstarGuitar07: sweet sweet
Get Are Frake: yea
Get Are Frake: im thinking of having it so there are key roman cities..
Get Are Frake: and you just travel between them (like on tradewinds,i udnno if you have ever played that)
Get Are Frake: and you can trade armor/etc
Get Are Frake: and fight people in the city your in
RockstarGuitar07: yeah
RockstarGuitar07: i was gonna suggest an Arena... but that might mess things up
Get Are Frake: hmmm
Get Are Frake: not bad
RockstarGuitar07: it just might really complicate things
Get Are Frake: like touranments where you can gain gold :-)
RockstarGuitar07: because it could be abused.
RockstarGuitar07: ah. tournaments= good idea for arena
Get Are Frake: yea
RockstarGuitar07: training/sparring=bad
Get Are Frake: :-)
RockstarGuitar07: training/sparring= best players could just train/spar with each other and own it up
Get Are Frake: yea
Get Are Frake: im thinking "Tournaments held by the Senate"
Get Are Frake: :-)
RockstarGuitar07: yeah
Get Are Frake: and at the end of round... the top Exp guy becomes "emporer"
Get Are Frake: ti'll next round
Get Are Frake: where i make a new plot ;-)
RockstarGuitar07: what privleges does this emporer get?
Get Are Frake: lol, none
Get Are Frake: just he's the best :-P
RockstarGuitar07: haha ok
RockstarGuitar07: This weekend(fri/sat) DON'T PLAN ANYTHING lol.
RockstarGuitar07: i do want to make a movie though... heh
Get Are Frake: :-)
RockstarGuitar07: i know you'll forget and you and your LCS clan will do something
RockstarGuitar07: i was thinking something along the lines of 'behavior'
RockstarGuitar07: sorta like if you continue to attack smaller people
RockstarGuitar07: then you get a bad 'reputation'
RockstarGuitar07: and your diplomatic rating (or maybe a different attribute... like 'Exposure' )goes down
RockstarGuitar07: buuuuuuuut.
RockstarGuitar07: that could also be REALLY FRUSTRATING ;P
Get Are Frake: yea
RockstarGuitar07: scratch that, i don't want to severly complicate things
Get Are Frake: i see what you mean :-)
RockstarGuitar07: unless you could find a way to sort of incorporate that
RockstarGuitar07: bleh i'm getting a whole bunch of complicated idears.
Get Are Frake: yea
Get Are Frake: same
RockstarGuitar07: Strength, Dexterity, Inteligence, Agility
RockstarGuitar07: bleh
RockstarGuitar07: you just ask when you  want something, it's your game.
Get Are Frake: lol
Get Are Frake: brainstorm=good :-)
Get Are Frake: im trying to figure out how much experience to add from like weapons and stuff
RockstarGuitar07: yeah...
RockstarGuitar07: there should be a 50/50 balance between militarily gained exp, and diplomatically gained exp
Get Are Frake: nice idea
Get Are Frake: :-)
Get Are Frake: im gonna save this convo in a text document, btw :-)
RockstarGuitar07: aight
RockstarGuitar07: well...
RockstarGuitar07: i have one question
RockstarGuitar07: if i attack somebody... and win (assuming i'll be able to attack peeps)
RockstarGuitar07: what exactly will the loser lose... and the winner win
RockstarGuitar07: if that makes sense
RockstarGuitar07: like: will i gain exp, and they lose, and also gain some 'resources' or what
RockstarGuitar07: if you dont have answers i understand hah
RockstarGuitar07: i don't want to flood you with ideas/thoughts/questions
RockstarGuitar07: anyways
RockstarGuitar07: i'm gonna go read a bit
Get Are Frake: k
Get Are Frake: peace
RockstarGuitar07: if you have any burning questions any time within the next 45ish minutes.
RockstarGuitar07: hit me up.
Get Are Frake: wait
RockstarGuitar07: (one last thought for the road...
Get Are Frake: to asnwer ur question
RockstarGuitar07: you first
Get Are Frake: when you attack someone you gain exp(more than them) they gain exp.. and you steal gold too (maybe armor/weapons/shields.. i think you'll have a health too)
RockstarGuitar07: hmm
RockstarGuitar07: ok
RockstarGuitar07: (my thought was, should different weapon types [i.e. different sorts of swords] have their own stats? like weight and such... like the heavier it is the more damage it does, but you're slower to attack)
Get Are Frake: hmm, nice
Get Are Frake: probably after beta
Get Are Frake: :-)
RockstarGuitar07: (i already don't like it, cause that complicates things, cause then you'd have to calculate how many times you can 'attack' with other thigns)
RockstarGuitar07: YEAH
RockstarGuitar07: i'm out. bye
Get Are Frake: later
